# #  Module 2 Required Coding Activity  
# Introduction to Python Unit 1  
# 
# This is an activity based on code similar to the Jupyter Notebook **`Practice_MOD02_1-3_IntroPy.ipynb`** which you may have completed.
# 
# | Some Assignment Requirements |  
# |:-------------------------------|  
# | **NOTE:** This program requires a **function** be defined, created and called. The call will send values based on user input.  The function call must capture a `return` value that is used in print output.  The function will have parameters and `return` a string and should otherwise use code syntax covered in module 2.  |  
#  
# ## Program: fishstore()
# create and test fishstore()
# - **fishstore() takes 2 string arguments: fish & price**
# - **fishstore returns a string in sentence form**  
# - **gather input for fish_entry and price_entry to use in calling fishstore()**
# - **print the return value of fishstore()**
# >example of output: **`Fish Type: Guppy costs $1`**

# In[8]:


# [ ] create, call and test fishstore() function 
# then PASTE THIS CODE into edX
def fish_type():
    type_fish = input("enter type of fish: ")
    return type_fish
def fish_cost():
    cost_fish = input("enter cost of fish: ")
    return cost_fish
def fishstore(type_fish,cost_fish):
    return ("Fish Type: " + type_fish + " costs $" + cost_fish)
print (fishstore(fish_type(),fish_cost()))
